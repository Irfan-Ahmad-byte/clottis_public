**Q: What is Solana (SOL)?**
A: Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform that enables fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of the Solana network.

**Q: How does staking work?**
A: When you stake SOL, you delegate your tokens to a validator who helps secure the network. In return, you earn rewards based on the validator's performance and your staked amount.

A: You can start staking with just ‚Ç®500 worth of SOL.

**Q: Can I unstake anytime?**
A: Yes, you can unstake your SOL at any time without penalties.

**Q: What happens if the validator goes offline?**
